## Prediction of Forest Cover Type

This project tackles the Kaggle challenge to [predict forest cover type](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction) from cartographic data.
The data includes features elevation, aspect, slope, soil types, hillshade at various daytime hours, presence of wilderness areas, and distances to hydrology, roadways and fire points.
The seven types of forest cover are Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Cottonwood/Willow, Aspen, Douglas-fir and Krummholz.
To classify the forest cover type, we used a random forest classifier and extra random trees.
